# Birds-Classifier-Deep-Learnning-Models

This project aims at building a bird classification model by using deep learnning models. 

Two major deep learnning models are explored for comparison, with one of the two being trained with CNN Model, while the another being achieved by a pre-trained model from Hugging Face.


## The Two Deep Learnning Models
- The Model trained with CNN Model:
  - prepared by Flora Wong Yuen Ling

- The Model achieved upon a pre-trained model from Hugging Face:
  - prepared by Kun Bi

## The Dataset
Source: [Bird Species dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umairshahpirzada/birds-20-species-image-classification/data) from Kaggle

Contains:
- Classes: 20 Bird Species
- Training Images: 3208 
- Test Images: 100 (5 images per species)
- Validation Images: 100  (5 images per species)
- Prediction Images: 6
